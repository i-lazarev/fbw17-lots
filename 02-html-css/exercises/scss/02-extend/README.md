# SCCC Extend - Exercise #1

Look at the given CSS file. Make a backup of it / copy it to style-orig.css (to keep it as a reference, in case you mess up :-)).

Convert the file style.css to SCSS.

Within the file:

Use @extend as much as possible so that selectors inherit styling from other selectors.

Also there may be some duplicate styles that you can simplify.

Caution: You cannot use the @extend keyword within media queries.

No styling is involved in this task.
